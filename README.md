# Project
Qorvo, our sponsor for this project, specializes in components for wireless, wired and smart electronic devices. One of the components they make is semiconductors, a critical part of almost every modern electronic. These semiconductors have hundreds or dies/locations and get tested thoroughly. This makes a lot of data, too much to expect a human to be able to analyze, so Qorvo asked us, senior students at OSU-cascades, to make a pipeline that sanitizes and prepares the data, and runs it through a machine learning algorithm to produce distinct groups based on patterns and anomalies in the test data. 

Our project is mostly proprietarty code and therefore cannot provide more source code. The main overview is included in [this file.](https://github.com/captn-hook/Capstone-Documents/blob/patch-1/Databricks%20Readme.pdf)
